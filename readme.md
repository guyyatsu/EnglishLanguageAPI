# Lab-93 Dictionary API & Linguistic Analysis Tools
This package offers a simple command-line command for scraping the definition of a word from `dictionary.com`
and returning it to the user.  It also provides a mechanism for building your own in-house dictionary from a
list of over 20,000 words.


## Installation
The module is available on Pip, so all you have to do is type:
```
pip install EnglishLanguageAPI
```
And bobs your uncle.


## Usage
To use the single-word lookup, the command is:
```
EnglishLanguageAPI {word}
```
